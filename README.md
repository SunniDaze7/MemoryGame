# MemoryGame
Memory game built by following along with Ania Kubow's youtube tutorial! I plan to make updates later including custom cards, a more aesthetic look for the user and more fluid functionality
The page is responsive and the user can keep their score via a fixed element at the bottom of the page.
The game is originally included in portfolio site soon to be finalyzed but I optimized it here to be used alone.
